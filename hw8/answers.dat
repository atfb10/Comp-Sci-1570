My plan has five basic parts. One, get us *noun* independent, North American *noun* independent. That creates about 4 million jobs.
And that's why independent *noun* looking at this said the only way to meet the other candidate's *noun* of not reducing the *noun* or -- or -- or not adding to the *noun* is by burdening middle-class *noun*.
Your question - your question is one that's being asked by college *noun* all over this country. I was in Pennsylvania with someone who had just graduated - this was in Philadelphia - and she said, "I've got my *noun*. I can't find a job.
Natural *noun* production is the highest it's been in decades. We have seen increases in *noun* production and *noun* employment. But what I've also said is we can't just produce traditional source of *noun*.
It's small *noun* that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small *noun* people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business *noun* are down to a 30-year low.
First of all, I don't have *noun*. I don't have *noun* of a scale that you're talking about.
And, by the way, I like *noun*. I'm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean *noun*. People in the *noun* industry feel like it's getting crushed by our policies.
Well, I think -- let's talk about *noun*, because I think it's instructive.
I don't want to cost jobs. My priority is *noun*.
My priority is putting *noun* back to work in America. They're suffering in this country. And we talk about *noun*. Look at the evidence of the last four *noun*. It's absolutely extraordinary.
Good. I'm glad you raised that, and it's a -- it's a *noun* issue. I think it's not just an *noun* issue, I think it's a *noun* issue.
Spain -- Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on *noun*. We're now spending 42 percent of our economy on *noun*. I don't want to go down the path to Spain.
I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more *noun* coming in because they're working.
Now, I've identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help *noun*.
Right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving *noun* overseas. I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense.
Ultimately, we're going to have to make some *noun*. And if we're asking for no revenue, then that means that we've got to get rid of a whole bunch of *noun*.
Try and get *noun* these days. It's hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of *noun* you have to have. 
I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our -- of our *noun* and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good *noun*.
Look, the genius of America is the free *noun* system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on *noun*, make their own decisions.
And when it comes to *noun* what I've said is we've got to reform schools that are not working.
The role of government: Look behind us. The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those *noun*.
You know, this is where *noun* matter, because *noun* reflect choices.
In the first place I've never suggested that *noun* was lost except for the present. In my speech last night I indicated that I thought that *noun* one day again would be free.
For younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring. Oh, I just thought about *noun*.
We're going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the - the world of *noun* and other parts of the world, reject this radical violent *noun*, which is - it's certainly not on the run.
That - that Detroit - that Detroit *noun* - that Detroit *noun* and the rest of the *noun* - way off the *noun*.
But what I've also said is we can't just produce traditional *noun* of *noun*; we've also got to look to the *noun*.
And then what you've got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the *noun* precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent *noun*.
Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad *noun*, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to -- to kill them, to take *noun* out of the picture.
That's -- that's important, of course. But the *noun* that we're going to have to pursue is a -- is a pathway to get the *noun* to be able to reject extremism on its own.
We don't want *noun*, we don't want *noun*. That's not the right course for us. The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the -- the *noun* who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these -- these jihadists, but also help the Muslim *noun*.
It's wonderful that Libya seems to be making some *noun*, despite this terrible tragedy.
I'm glad that you recognize that *noun* is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said *noun*, not *noun*; you said *noun*, in the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their *noun* back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.
You've said that first we should not have a *noun* in Afghanistan then you said we should. Now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong but you were also confusing and sending mixed *noun* both to our troops and our *noun*.
Thank you for asking a question. That is a very good *noun*. How are you my friend? It's wodnerful to be here. Well, first of all this is a campaign about the *noun*. And over the last several years you've seen greater and greater *noun* in this country.
We had hoped to come back together but instead you've seen *noun* pull us apart. Politics has driven *noun* apart in some respect.
So my campaign is about the *noun* of America. And I'm concerned about *noun*. I'm concerned about the fact that over the past four years *noun* has become harder for Americans.
More *noun* have fallen into poverty. More *noun* we just learned have had to go onto food stamps. When the president took office 32 million *noun* were on food stamps.
Today 47 million *noun* are on food stamps. Now I know that I'm not going to get 100 percent of the *noun* vote. And my campaign will focus on those *noun* we think we can bring in to support me.  This is a campaign about helping people who need *noun*.
The *noun* in the middle class need help because their *noun* have gone down every year for the last four years. *noun* are harder to find.  We have 23 million *noun* out of work, or stopped looking for *noun*.
Half the kids coming out of college aren't able to get *noun*. And this is a tough time for *noun*.
Politics has driven *noun* apart in some respect. So my campaign is about the *noun* of America. And I'm concerned about *noun*. I'm concerned about the fact that over the past four years *noun* has become harder for Americans. More *noun* have fallen into poverty. More *noun* we just learned have had to go onto food stamps. When the President took office 32 million *noun* were on food stamps. 
I have a record. I've demonstrated my capacity to help the *noun*. When I was Governor of my state, our *noun* rose every year. We brought *noun* down to 4.7 percent. Our *noun* became number one in the nation. So, that kind of record shows I care about *noun* 100 percent. People in America are going to have a better *noun* if they elect me the next President. 
The answer is this. The *noun* system generally, I think we all agree, is broken and it's been a political *noun* for years and years on the part of both Republicans and Democrats. It needs to be fixed. So it's time to put the politics aside and I will actually reform the *noun* system to make it work for the people of America.
Well, let me begin by talking about what we do for our *noun* system. I will make sure that people know that they get *noun* in a transparent and clear way. They shouldn't have to hire *noun* to find out how to get *noun* legally. I want to make sure that instead of having our *noun* offered, we provide instead the chance to pull *noun* together. I want that to be the favored system for *noun*. 
Look, *noun* is critical for America. I love *noun*. No nation on earth brings in a million *noun* a year into their country. This country lives, in part, by virtue of the vitality of our *noun* system. But at the same time, to protect *noun* we have to secure our *noun* and what I like about the *noun* law was that the measure that says we're going to have an *noun* verification system.
We're going to continue a *noun* program. Under that program, those who graduated from *noun* school and passed our graduation exam, those who passed it in the top quarter of their *noun* school got a four-year *noun* free ride to the  institutions of higher learning that are public. 
So I care. I care about your *noun* and helping people of modest means get *noun* and we'll continue a *noun* program. I think the budget called for *noun* being capped out at their current high level. My inclination would be to have them go with the rate of *noun*. 
I think it's important in higher education that we get serious about the fact that the inflation of *noun* has been much faster than inflation generally. And my view is we have to hold down the rate of *noun* increases and *noun* increases in higher education.
Yeah, that's a great question and it counts, and you point out. There are two million more *noun* living in poverty today than when the President took office. We've now had 56, I believe, straight months with *noun* above 10 percent for *noun* Americans. It's unacceptable. And so my plan has five major parts, and I know you don't want me to go into detail on all five. I'd take over the whole show. But let me describe what they are. Number one, we have an enormous advantage with our *noun* resources. Taking full advantage of *noun*, *noun*, *noun*, *noun* and *noun* will create about four million jobs by itself. That's number one.
*noun*. The opportunity to add more *noun*, particularly in Latin America, where there's a natural advantage in time zone and *noun* for us. That's going to create more *noun* and we've got to crack down on *noun* and any nation that cheats on *noun* because it kills *noun* here.
We have to make sure that our people have the *noun* to succeed. I want to get our training *noun* to do that, and I want to make sure our kids in school get the kind of *noun* they need for the jobs of tomorrow. Our *noun* are not performing at the level they should. I want to put the *noun* and the *noun* first. I think the *noun* union has to go behind. We've got to put our *noun* first.
We've got to get America on track to a balanced *noun*. I think it's immoral for us to spend our kids' *noun*, to pass on those *noun*. And *noun* won't come here if they think we're on the road to Greece, and that's where we are today. We have to have a pro-small *noun* agenda. *noun*, *noun*, *noun*, all those things encouraging small *noun*.
Small *noun*, of course, Americans lead in creating small *noun* over the population at large. I want to have an administration that's focused on getting small *noun* growing again. Thank you.
My agenda is making sure that this economy, once again, is creating the kind of *noun* that make sure that people coming out of college can get good *noun*. We've always, as a nation, snapped up young people coming out of college. They started their careers and that provides them the *noun* that they can start a family, they can build a future. But that's changed in these last few years.
And so we crafted a program that worked for our state, and I believe the right course for *noun* reform is to say for each state we're going to give you the *noun* dollars you've had in the past, plus grow them with inflation, plus one percent, and you as the states are now going to be given targets to move people towards *noun* and you craft programs that are right for your state.
The nature of the American experiment has been letting states build *noun* and *noun* that work for each of them, share those *noun* with one another. The idea of a federal government stepping in and telling people here's the kind of *noun* you have to have; you don't get the choice of whether you want *noun* or whether you want *noun*. The government is going to ultimately have a *noun* that tells you what kind of *noun* you can receive.
America is falling behind in *noun* and *noun*. How are we going to lead the world as a nation if our *noun* are scoring in the bottom quartile, or bottom third of performance around the world? We can compare and learn how it is that we could elevate the quality of *noun*. And the answer as to the single most important thing you can do to improve the *noun* of a child is to hire high-quality *noun*, and promote them, and pay them, and make sure that the very best *noun* come into teaching.
I'm concerned about America. I'm concerned about the direction of America. I'm concerned about the fact that we have 23 million Americans that are out of *noun* or stopped looking for *noun*. I'm concerned about the fact that we've gone for over 50 months with *noun* above 10 percent. I'm concerned about the fact that so many young Americans don't get the kind of *noun* they need for the *noun* that they have to have for tomorrow.
It's a critical time for our country. Where you're going to decide what kind of an America we're going to have. I know what it takes to get *noun* back in this country. To see rising *noun* again. To make sure our kids have the kind of *noun* they deserve.
