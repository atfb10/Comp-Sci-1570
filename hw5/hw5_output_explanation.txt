//          file, hw5.cpp.

Upon the user successfully entering all correct values for input;
meaning all positive, whole numbers in which the upper boundaries
are greater than or equal to lower boundaries, a table comprised
of three columns is printed to the screen. The left-most column
of the table is the number of animal types used in the creation 
of the burger. The center column is the number of animal parts 
used to create the burger. The right-most column is the projected
profit that Krusty would make off of the burger sale. This profit
is calculated using the number of number of animal types, the 
left-most column, the number of animal parts, the center column,
and plugging these values into Professor Frink's mathematical model
that has been provided to us in the assignment description.
